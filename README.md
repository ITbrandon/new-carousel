# Added a 5 second interval that will change slides every 5 seconds this was implemented using the set Interval method. The only issue I encountered was when I implemented this feature I notice that the interval would not reset after I click next or previous slide so there were times when I click next and it would go to paladin and then 2 seconds later went to thief so the way I fixed this was by putting a function and putting the set interval into a variable and clearing if you clicked on next or previous and then right after calling it again this would effectively reset th e interval
